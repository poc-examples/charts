  steps:
    ## Cachi2 is a CLI tool designed specifically to pre-fetch your project's dependencies, 
    ## which is particularly useful for making your build process hermetic.
    ## encourages or mandates best practices in dependency management, such as building from 
    ## source and avoiding pre-built artifacts like Python wheels.
    ## Cachi2 generates a manifest of all dependencies fetched, aiding in audits and compliance checks.
    ## To be hermetic we need to add network security policies that denies by default egress and ingress.
    ## Base images should be pulled into the internal registry
    ## Stage and Update: Set up a secure, isolated staging environment where base images are downloaded and updated (e.g., running yum update -y). This environment should have restricted internet access, used only for fetching updates.
    ## Security Scanning: After updating, thoroughly scan the images for vulnerabilities using security tools. Only images that pass all security checks should be moved to your internal registry.
    ## Promotion to Internal Registry: Once validated, promote the updated images to your internal registry from where they can be safely used in production builds without additional external access.
    ## Outputs Cachi2 SBOM & Pulls Dependencies into the source repo in the deps folder
